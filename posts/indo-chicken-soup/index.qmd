1. Grind peppercorns, coriander, cumin, turmeric, garlic, ginger, and shallot 
(or onion) in a small food processor or mortar and pestle. Add a little water 
if needed.
1. Heat chicken stock in a large pot, ideally one with a steamer insert. 
Add the raw chicken and the lemon grass. Cook about 20-30 minutes until chicken 
is done. 
1. During the last 10 minutes or so, steam the bok choy or other greens. If
you don't have a steamer insert, you can just add them to the soup at the
end, or steam separately.
1. Remove chicken and shred. Discard lemon grass.
1. Meanwhile, heat a few tablespoons of oil in a small pan. Add the spice paste
and fry for a few minutes.
1. Bring a pot of water to boil and cook noodles according to the package
directions. Drain and rinse.
1. Add the spice paste to the soup. 
1. Assemble: put noodles in a bowl. Add soup, shredded chicken, a boiled egg,
and the greens. Garnish with cilantro and fried shallots. Serve with lime
and/or chili paste.
