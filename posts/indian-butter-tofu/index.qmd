:::


- juice of 1 lemon
- 1 Tbsp ground cumin
- 1 Tbsp ground turmeric
- 500g extra-firm tofu, cut into 1 inch cubes
- 1/2 head cauliflower, separated into florets
- 4-6 oz butter or ghee

1. Combine lemon juice, cumin, turmeric and 1&ndash;2 Tbsp of water in a large
bowl that will hold the tofu and cauliflower. Mix to form a slurry. Add tofu 
and cauliflower and toss to marinate.
2. Heat butter or ghee over medium-low in a large lidded pot. Add onions and
saute for 5
minutes, until they are beginning to brown. 
3. Add garlic and ginger and saute briefly.
4. Add the tomatoes, the garam masala, and the cayenne pepper. I use about 2T
of the garam masala and a reasonable amount of cayenne, but both should be to
taste. Break up the tomatoes a bit, and simmer, covered for about 10 minutes.
5. Blend the tomatoes with an imersion blender. Add the coconut milk and the 
tofu+cauliflower mixture. Stir gently. Cover and simmer 5-10 minutes, until the 
cauliflower is cooked to your desired texture.

Serve with rice or naan.
