This is super tasty and based on the 
[Philly roast pork sandwich](https://www.seriouseats.com/philly-roast-pork-sandwich-recipe-8605326) 
from Leah Colins. 

Everything can be prepared completely in advance, but the pork needs at least 
a day total in the fridge, so it's a 2 day project. When spread out, 
it assembles quickly, and each step is mostly unsupervised.

**For the pork, day 1**

1. In a bowl, combine garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and red
pepper flakes. Cut 1 inch cross-hatches into the fat-cap of the pork. Place
pork on a double layer of plastic wrap, and coat all exposed sides with the
spice mixture. Tie with kitchen twine so that it is shaped like a brick. Wrap
tightly with the plastic and refrigerate for 12--24 hours.
1. Heat oven to 325ºF. In a dutch oven, heat oil over medium and add the onions.
Cook until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add pork on top of the onions,
fat side up. Add chicken stock, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for about 
two hours, until the internal temperature reaches 180ºF. Remove the pork from
the oven, let rest for 1 hour, then transfer to the refrigerator for at least
2 hours. Save jus for later.

**Assembly**

1. Heat a skillet over medium, add
oil and broccoli rabe, salt and pepper. Cook about 5 minutes, then add garlic.
If the pan is too dry, add a little water to loosen.
1. Meanwhile, slice the pork very thinly. Combine the amount you will use with 
some of the jus. Save the rest for later. Cover and microwave until heated 
through. 
1. Slice rolls if needed, add provolone and broil briefly until bubly.
1. Place pork, broccoli rabe, and sliced peppers on the sandwich and serve with
a few spponfuls of jus.
