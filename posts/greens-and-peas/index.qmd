I've made this a few times (often cheating with the pressure cooker). It's 
very satisfying in the winter, and maybe brings good luck!

This recipe makes 4-6 servings but can be doubled. The beans freeze well.

It requires soaking the beans the night before.

:::

### Beans

- 1 pound black-eyed peas
- 1 pound smoked ham hock (with bone), or 1 pound ham steak
- 1 large white/yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp allspice

### Greens

- 1 bunch collard greens
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)
- 4 scallions
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp vegetable oil

1. Soak beans about 8-12 hours, either overnight or start in the morning the
day you want to cook
1. Drain beans and rinse briefly. Add to a heavy dutch oven with ham hock and 
8 cups water. Add bay leaf. For the onion, peel it but keep the root intact. 
Trim the root a bit, then quarter the onion through the root so the quarters
hold together. Add to the dutch oven. Add allspice, 2 garlic cloves (whole), 
a good bit of black pepper and a hefty pinch of salt.
1. Bring beans to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer (occasional
bubbles breaking the surface). Skim and discard any foam that rises to the
surface with a slotted spoon. Simmer for 90 minutes to 2 hours. The water
should cover the beans by 1 inch. Add more if needed, and stir occasionally.
1. Meanwhile, wash collards and remove the stems if desired (definitely the 
bottom bits). Lay the whole bunch on top of each other, roll the leaves, then
slice across the roll into thin ribbons (about 1/2 inch wide). Slice or mince
2 cloves of garlic.
1. Turn off the heat. Check broth for seasoning and adjust salt and pepper. 
Remove ham. Chop meat in rough pieces and set aside. Remove onion, garlic, and
bay leaf and discard.
1. Set a large pan (with a lid) over medium heat and add the oil. Add garlic
and red 
pepper, and reduce heat to medium low. After about 30 seconds, add the 
collards, season with salt and black pepper, add 1 cup of water, and stir. Add
the chopped ham from the beans. Cover and cook until the greens are soft,
about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the scallions crosswise. Check seasoning.

To serve, but the greens in a bowl and add a ladle or two of beans and broth.
Top with some scallions and hot sauce (Franks or Tobasco) if desired.
