Delicious on many things. 

![](miso-vinagrette.jpg)

Typical usage is on a salad of lettuce; crunchy
stuff like celery, carrots, radish, cucumber; pulled rotisserie chicken;
and herbs like cilantro, parsley, mint, scallions, or a mix. 

Garnish with fried 
shallots or French-fried onions or pumpkin seeds or avocado.

Also, makes a great coleslaw: combine coleslaw mix with dressing and 
salted peanuts.

*makes approx. 2 cups*
