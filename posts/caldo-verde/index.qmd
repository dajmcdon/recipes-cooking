I make this soup very frequently. It's easy, and doesn't require stock. 

I prefer
the version with ground sausage rather than smoked+sliced. Most of the time, I 
omit the tomatoes.

- 1lb bulk sausage. Ideally something spicy and Portuguese or Spanish (linguica). Hot Italian works well. Alternatively, one of the smoked (cooked) sausages like kielbasa (again, better if spicy), sliced into half-moons.
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2 bunches kale (I prefer Lacinto) or collard greens 
- 3-4 yukon gold potatoes, 
- 1/2 can diced tomatoes (optional)

1. Add some oil to a large pot and brown the sausage. If bulk, break it up 
after it starts to brown. If using cooked sausage, 
flip it around a bit to get some color. Remove the slices if using, leave the bulk.
2. If the pan is dry, add a little more oil. Add the onion and cook until soft.
3. Meanwhile, peel and dice the potatoes.
4. Add the potatoes, then 2&ndash;3 quarts of water.
5. Slice the greens into thin ribbons and add to the pot. Add the tomatoes and 
their juices if using. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 
about 20 minutes, when the potatoes should be completely cooked and beginning
to fall apart.
6. Using a potato masher, smash the potatoes in the soup, as desired.
7. If you used cooked sausage, add it back to the pot, and heat through.

Serve with crusty bread and wine.
