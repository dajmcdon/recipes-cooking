This is a go-to meal for us. Very easy to make with things mostly on hand
and exceedingly delicious.

1. Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large pot. If using the garlic, fry
for about a minute. Watch carefully because it burns quickly. Going for
a tan-ish colour. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
1. Add the pork and brown. Break it up as much as possible. Bring a pot
of water to a boil for the rice noodles.
1. Add the chicken stock. Top up with water until you have as much as 
you'll want. I like it more brothy, so I end up with about 3 quarts 
total. Add the soy sauce and fish sauce, if using.
1. Check noodles, cook until done. Drain, rinse, and set aside.
1. Bring soup to a simmer, taste for seasoning (it should be reasonably
salty, like instant ramen) and cook about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, slice
the onions into very thin half-moons and chop the greens into bite-sized
pieces. Peel and chop the ginger.
1. Add 3/4 of the onion, the greens and the ginger to the pot and cook
until the greens are done (5-10 minutes depending on the stalks). Chop 
the cilantro.
1. Assemble: put noodles in a bowl. Add soup. Garnish with remaining
raw onion, cilantro, and garlic. Add more soy sauce, fish sauce, or
sriracha if you like.
