    "text": "This is a go-to meal for us. Very easy to make with things mostly on hand and exceedingly delicious.\n8 servings\n\n\n\nLightly adapted from: NYT Cooking. Recipe by Alison Roman.\n\n1 pound ground pork\n3-6 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced (optional)\nred pepper flakes, to taste\n6-12 cups chicken broth\n1/4 cup soy sauce, (approx)\na few dashes fish sauce (optional)\n1/2 bunch cilantro\nlarge bunch spinach, yu choy, bok choy, rapini, swiss chard, or similar\n1 inch piece ginger\n6oz dried rice noodles\n2 medium onions\n\n\n\n\nHeat a few tablespoons of oil in a large pot. If using the garlic, fry for about a minute. Watch carefully because it burns quickly. Going for a tan-ish colour. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.\nAdd the pork and brown. Break it up as much as possible. Bring a pot of water to a boil for the rice noodles.\nAdd the chicken stock. Top up with water until you have as much as you’ll want. I like it more brothy, so I end up with about 3 quarts total. Add the soy sauce and fish sauce, if using.\nCheck noodles, cook until done. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\nBring soup to a simmer, taste for seasoning (it should be reasonably salty, like instant ramen) and cook about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, slice the onions into very thin half-moons and chop the greens into bite-sized pieces. Peel and chop the ginger.\nAdd 3/4 of the onion, the greens and the ginger to the pot and cook until the greens are done (5-10 minutes depending on the stalks). Chop the cilantro.\nAssemble: put noodles in a bowl. Add soup. Garnish with remaining raw onion, cilantro, and garlic. Add more soy sauce, fish sauce, or sriracha if you like."

    "text": "This was a favourite cocktail among my graduate school friends. We first tried it at a now-closed bar called Embury near the Strip District in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe bartender moved to Meat & Potatoes, and we kept ordering it (off menu) on occasional trips downtown (conveniently located across from Heinz Hall and the PSO). He eventually gave us the broad outlines of the recipe. It’s basically a Daiquiri made with gin, but made extra spicy, herbaceous, and delicious.\nAfter reading through Dave Arnold’s Liquid Intelligence, and with a big birthday approaching, I decided to try the “blender muddle”, to see if it would work as a batched cocktail to serve at a party (individual drinks would be far too much time).\nThe blender muddle will only work if you make at least 2 (possibly 4) drinks at once. You need the blades of the blender completely submerged in the alcohol to prevent the basil from turning brown. The result is neon green, and looks awesome. Leave out the bitters if you do this. Otherwise the neon green will become dirt brown.\nRecipe for 1 drink\n\n\n60 ml gin\n30 ml lemon juice\n20 ml 50/50 simple syrup\n3-4 dashes Angostura bitters (omit if blender muddling)\n2-3 1/2 inch slices of jalapeño\n1/2 inch knob of ginger, peeled\n5 basil leaves\nGround cayenne pepper\n\n\n\nCombine gin, jalapeño, ginger, and basil in the bottom of a blender. Make sure the blades (and all the solids) are completely covered. If you are planning to serve immediately, you can add the lemon juice. Blend for 5-10 seconds until pureed.\nCombine blender contents with simple syrup, bitters, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker. Add lots of ice and shake for 10-15 seconds.\nDouble strain into a chilled coupe glass and garnish with a bit of cayenne pepper if desired."

Cook until soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add pork on top of the onions, fat side up. Add chicken stock, cover, and place in the oven. Cook for about two hours, until the internal temperature reaches 180ºF. Remove the pork from the oven, let rest for 1 hour, then transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Save jus for later.\n\nAssembly\n\nHeat a skillet over medium, add oil and broccoli rabe, salt and pepper. Cook about 5 minutes, then add garlic. If the pan is too dry, add a little water to loosen.\nMeanwhile, slice the pork very thinly. Combine the amount you will use with some of the jus. Save the rest for later. Cover and microwave until heated through.\nSlice rolls if needed, add provolone and broil briefly until bubly.\nPlace pork, broccoli rabe, and sliced peppers on the sandwich and serve with a few spponfuls of jus."

Kenji López-Alt\n\n4 oz pork belly or thick sliced bacon, cut into lardons\n2.5 pounds chuck roast, brisket, or other stew beef\n6 oz crimini mushrooms\n1 pkg pearl onions, 15-20\n5 carrots\n3 stalks celery\n1 onion\n3 cups chicken stock\n3 packets gelatin\n1 small can tomato paste\n1 Tbsp soy sauce\n2 tsp fish sauce or 5 anchovies\n2 bay leaves\n1 tsp dried thyme or 3 sprigs fresh\n3 cloves of garlic, unpeeled\n1/2 cup sherry, dry vermouth, brandy, or wine\n4 T flour\n1 pound potatoes, peeled\n1.5 cups frozen peas\n\n\n\nSet the pressure cooker to Saute (on low), and render the pork or bacon. You may need to add a little water to help the rendering. Remove to a plate, leaving 2 T or so of rendered fat.\nMeanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions, and boil about 30 seconds. This will make them easy to peel quickly. Remove, drain, and let cool until you can peel them. You can trim the tops, but be careful with the bottoms. Keeping the bottom will help them stay whole later.\nCut beef into 2-3 large “steaks”. Season on both sides with salt and pepper. Add to the pressure cooker, increase to medium, and sear on both sides. About 5-10 minutes per side. Remove to the same plate as the pork.\nAdd quartered mushrooms to the cooker until browned. Remove to a different plate. Add the peeled pearl onions to the cooker until browned. Remove to the same plate as the mushrooms.\nCut the onion in half from pole to pole, trim the root and peel. Cut 2 carrots in half long ways. Cut the celery and carrots into 3-4 inch pieces. Add all of these and the garlic to the cooker and sear on 1-2 sides.\nCombine the tomato paste, chicken stock, soy sauce, fish sauce, and gelatin in a container and whisk to blend.\nCut the beef into chunks. Toss with the flour.\nWhen the large vegetables are seared, add the liquor or wine and scrape to deglaze all the stuck bits. Allow to reduce by half (about 2-3 minutes).\nAdd the beef, pork, and the stock mix to the cooker. Add the bay leaves and thyme. Seal the cooker and cook on high pressure for 30 minutes. Rapidly release steam.\nMeanwhile cut the remaining carrots and potatoes into chunks.\nOpen the cooker. Remove all the vegetables (which are now flavourless) and discard. Taste the liquid and adjust seasoning.\nAdd the potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and pearl onions. Seal the cooker and cook on high for 15 minutes. The rapidly release the steam.\nAdd the peas and stir. Taste again for seasoning. Serve immediately or let cool and refrigerate for a day before serving."

    "text": "This entire recipe takes about 3 days, from start to finish. But very little active time. Since the middle of the pandemic, I’ve been baking this once a week. Other than baguettes, we rarely buy bread anymore. And this costs almost nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSourdough starter\nWhole wheat flour\nAll purpose flour\nSalt\nEnameled cast-iron Dutch oven (with a lid)\nCorn meal\n\n\n\nDay 1 (8-12 hours start to finish, most inactive)\n\nRemove starter from fridge. Let sit for about 1 hour, to come to room temperature. (You don’t HAVE to let it sit, but I find it reduces the next resting step.)\nFeed the starter. Add 110g flour and 110g water. Stir vigorously. Cover. Place in a warm place until it at least doubles in volume, reaching the top of the jar. [Note: If the house is cool, I use the oven with the light on. It takes about 8 hours. On the counter takes 8 or so. If you leave it too long, it will either make a huge mess as it escapes the jar, or will consume all the flour you just added and start deflating.]\nCombine 220g fed/ripe starter with 600g flour, 400g water, and 18g salt in a large bowl. (I use a large, 500g stainless steel mixing bowl that has an air tight plastic lid.) Don’t forget the salt. I use 300/300 regular to whole wheat flour, but feel free to experiment. I found more WW to be too dry and crumbly. Mix well, cover, and let sit on the counter for an hour. You should have about 80-100g starter left. Put that back in the fridge. (If less, add equal parts flour and water until you do)\nPick up one corner of the dough, pull it out and up, and fold it over the top of the dough. You can be aggressive, but you won’t be pulling so hard that your hand is much above the bowl. Work your way around the dough for about a minute. Recover. And let sit 1 hour.\nRepeat step 4 twice more. The dough should start too feel more uniform and less sticky as you go. After your third round, put the covered bowl in the fridge.\nLeave it in the fridge for at least 24 hours and up to 4 days. Longer seems to be better, but only marginally.\n\n\n\nDay 3 (4 hours, about 30 minutes of active time)\n\nRemove dough from fridge. Let rest in the bowl for an hour.\nCover a clean bit of counter with a dusting of flour. (I now just use the inverted plastic bowl lid, and don’t use any flour, to be less messy.) Turn dough onto counter and shape into a ball. Cover with a towel and let rise for 1-2 hours. Currently, for me, an hour is enough since the starter is quite active. It should look a bit bigger and may flatten out a bit. About 30 minutes before it’s done, place a covered Dutch oven in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees.\nPrepare to bake. Set up a place near the dough to put the hot Dutch oven and its lid. When the oven is done preheating, remove the Dutch oven, and close the oven door. Remove the lid and spread some corn meal on the bottom to keep the bread from sticking. Quickly make 1-3 slashes across the top of the bread with a sharp knife or a bread knife, and drop it into the Dutch oven, slashes up. Put the lid back on, and put it in the oven.\nBake for 15 minutes and then remove the lid.\nBake another 35 minutes. You’re looking for a nice brown top, and a hollow sound. Or if you have an instant thermometer, 209 degrees in the coldest part.\nRemove from oven, take the bread out of the Dutch oven, and cool on a rack.\n\n\n\nBackground for making a starter\n\nCreating a starter\nMy starter lives in the fridge in a lidded 20oz glass jar. You could get some from a neighbour who bakes sourdough. I made it with bakers yeast from the Whole Foods Bakery (had no friends): ~20g yeast + 100g water + 100g flour. You could also use dry yeast in a packet, or nothing. But it will take more rounds of feeding to get vigorous enough. Basically, repeat steps 1 and 2 from Day 1 instructions a few times. That is: (1) Feed it 100g flour + 100g water, (2) stir vigorously, (3) let it rest for a while and see how long it takes to double in size. If it isn’t doubled after 12 hours, then remove about half. Throw the rest in the fridge for a few days. Repeat 2-3 times. What you’re looking for is for it to get to the point that it will double in size in 8 hours or less if left out. If it takes longer, then the starter isn’t yet ready for baking bread.\n\n\nMaintaining the starter\nIt needs to be fed about once a week. Less frequently, it gets too slack to leaven bread on one feeding. So I try to bake once a week. Otherwise, just feed it by removing about 200g and replacing with 100g each flour and water. It will likely be fine up to two weeks. Any longer, you’ll need to do the feeding process a few times. If you forget it for a month, it might start to look gross. It’s probably fine and can be rescued, but you may not want to."

    "text": "This is really a “template” for miso soup. All listed ingredients are optional except the soup base. I’ll usually make about 6-8 cups of broth for the 3-4 meals. I try to keep most ingredients “around” so I can throw this together if I don’t have time / ideas for dinner.\n\n\n\nThe instant dashi contains MSG. It doesn’t bother most people, but will put my mother in the hospital.\n\nSoup base\n\nmiso paste\nInstant Dashi, I use Ajinomoto HonDashi\n\n\n\nIngredients template\n\nSomething leafy (spinach, seaweed, parsley, etc.)\nSome stems (fennel, celery, asparagus, green beans, etc.)\nSome roots (carrot, daikon, radish, celery root, potato?)\nProtein (mushrooms, tofu, clams, rotisserie chicken, etc.)\n\n\n\nSeasonings (all optional)\n\nsoy sauce\nsesame oil\nsesame seeds\nanything else\n\n\n\nMake the soup base. Bring water to a simmer. Remove about 1/2 cup to mix with the miso paste. Add the instant dashi powder (1 tsp per 2 cups water).\nYou’ll need about 1 Tbsp miso paste per 2 cups of liquid. Add it to the removed liquid and stir until incorporated. If your paste is old, it helps to force it through a fine strainer. Or you could use a small blender or a miso muddler. Mix back into the simmering stock.\nAdd all ingredients. You want at least one thing from each category. They should all cook pretty quickly. Taste for saltiness, and add salt or soy sauce."
